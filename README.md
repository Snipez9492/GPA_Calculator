# GPA_Calculator

I created a GPA Calculator that take a maximum of courses along with number of credits and letter grade. After hitting the Enter button it will calculate your GPA and display it. There is also a clear button, that will clear everything and reset the calulator. This was created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I used an object to store the letter grades along with it's decimal value. I also utilized dom using JavaScript in order to process entires and clear entries when needed.
